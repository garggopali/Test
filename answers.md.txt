1) Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

I tried to keep it simple and minimum. Apart from automatic generated structure - one index page for simple GUI plus one homecontroller
to create a post endpoint, which holds the functionality to process the text file. This post endpoint is good to test via Postman.


2) What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding
test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

I would love to extend the functionality and put more checks, for example to exclude special symbols from the text or handling long files. Also I would like to handle line
breaks in a more effecient way.
